# 2503. Maximum Number of Points From Grid Queries
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an array `queries` of size `k`.

Find an array `answer` of size `k` such that for each integer `queries[i]`, you start in the top-left cell of the matrix and repeat the following process:

- If `queries[i]` is strictly greater than the value of the current cell that you are in, then you get one point if it is your first time visiting this cell, and you can move to any adjacent cell in all 4 directions: up, down, left, and right.
- Otherwise, you do not get any points, and you end this process.

After the process, `answer[i]` is the maximum number of points you can get. Note that for each query you are allowed to visit the same cell multiple times.

Return the resulting array `answer`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```python
grid = [[1,2,3],
        [2,5,7],
        [3,5,1]]
queries = [5,6,2]
```
**Output:**  
```python
[5, 8, 1]
```
**Explanation:** The diagrams above show which cells we visit to get points for each query.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
```python
grid = [[5,2,1],
        [1,1,2]]
queries = [3]
```
**Output:**  
```python
[0]
```
**Explanation:** We can not get any points because the value of the top-left cell is already greater than or equal to 3.

## Constraints:
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `4 <= m * n <= 10^5`
- `k == queries.length`
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`
- `1 <= grid[i][j], queries[i] <= 10^6`

## Solution

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
import heapq

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class IndexedQuery:
    queryIndex: int
    query: int
    
    def __iter__(self):
        yield self.queryIndex
        yield self.query

class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, grid: list[list[int]], queries: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        DIRS = ((0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0))
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        ans = [0] * len(queries)
        minHeap = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)]  # (grid[i][j], i, j)
        seen = {(0, 0)}
        accumulate = 0

        for queryIndex, query in sorted([IndexedQuery(i, query) for i, query in enumerate(queries)], key=lambda x: x.query):
            while minHeap:
                val, i, j = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
                if val >= query:
                    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (val, i, j))
                    break
                accumulate += 1
                for dx, dy in DIRS:
                    x = i + dx
                    y = j + dy
                    if x < 0 or x == m or y < 0 or y == n:
                        continue
                    if (x, y) in seen:
                        continue
                    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (grid[x][y], x, y))
                    seen.add((x, y))
            ans[queryIndex] = accumulate
        return ans
```

## Explanation
1. We use a **priority queue (min-heap)** to keep track of the smallest cell values we can visit.<br>
2. We process the queries in increasing order to efficiently track visited cells.<br>
3. A **set (`seen`)** keeps track of visited cells to prevent revisiting them unnecessarily.<br>
4. For each query, we explore the grid **using BFS**, keeping track of the total points we can collect.<br>
5. If the smallest value in the heap is greater than the query, we stop exploring.
<br>
This approach ensures an efficient solution using **heap operations and BFS traversal**, making it feasible for large constraints.<br>

## Complexity Analysis
- Sorting `queries`: `O(k log k)`
- Processing each query using BFS: `O(m * n log (m * n))`
- Overall Complexity: **`O((m * n + k) log (m * n))`**
