# 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower

You are given a **0-indexed 2D integer array** `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question `0`) and make a decision whether to **solve** or **skip** each question. 

- Solving question `i` will earn you `pointsi` points but you will be unable to solve each of the next `brainpoweri` questions.
- If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

### Example 1:
```python
Input: questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
Output: 5
```
**Explanation:**
- Solve question `0`: Earn `3` points, will be unable to solve the next `2` questions.
- Unable to solve questions `1` and `2`.
- Solve question `3`: Earn `2` points.
- **Total points earned:** `3 + 2 = 5`.

### Example 2:
```python
Input: questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: 7
```
**Explanation:**
- Skip question `0`
- Solve question `1`: Earn `2` points, will be unable to solve the next `2` questions.
- Unable to solve questions `2` and `3`.
- Solve question `4`: Earn `5` points.
- **Total points earned:** `2 + 5 = 7`.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= questions.length <= 10^5`
- `questions[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 10^5`

---

## Solution Approach
We use **recursion with memoization (top-down dynamic programming)** to maximize the total points. The recursive function explores two choices:
1. Solve the current question and skip the next `brainpoweri` questions.
2. Skip the current question and move to the next one.

We store already computed results in a dictionary (`brainpower`) to avoid redundant computations.

### Python Solution:
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        brainpower = {}
        
        def dfs(i):
            if i >= len(questions):
                return 0
            if i in brainpower:
                return brainpower[i]
            
            brainpower[i] = max(questions[i][0] + dfs(i + questions[i][1] + 1), dfs(i + 1))
            return brainpower[i]
        
        return dfs(0)
```

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- Each question is processed only **once**, thanks to memoization.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of questions.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, due to the recursion stack and memoization dictionary.

---

## Explanation:
1. We define a recursive function `dfs(i)`, where `i` is the index of the current question.
2. If `i` exceeds the length of `questions`, return `0`.
3. If the result is already computed for `i`, return the stored value.
4. Otherwise, compute:
   - The maximum points obtained by solving question `i` and skipping the next `brainpoweri` questions.
   - The maximum points obtained by skipping question `i`.
5. Store the result in `brainpower` and return the maximum.

This approach ensures an **optimal** solution with **efficient computation**.
