# Problem 2685: Count the Number of Complete Components

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of vertices in an undirected graph (numbered from `0` to `n - 1`). You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there is an undirected edge between vertices `ai` and `bi`.

Return the number of **complete connected components** of the graph.

A **connected component** is a subgraph where there is a path between any two vertices, and no vertex is connected to vertices outside the subgraph.

A **complete component** is a connected component where there is an edge between every pair of its vertices.

## Example 1:

**Input:**
n = 6 edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]

**Output:**

3

**Explanation:**  
- Component `{0, 1, 2}` is complete.  
- Component `{3, 4}` is complete.  
- Component `{5}` (isolated node) is also complete.

---

## Example 2:

**Input:**

n = 6 edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]


**Output:**

1

**Explanation:**  
- Component `{0, 1, 2}` is complete.  
- Component `{3, 4, 5}` is not complete (missing edge between `4` and `5`).  
- Nodes `{5}` is connected as part of `{3, 4, 5}`.

---

## Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`
- No repeated edges.

---

## Solution Approach

The solution involves:
1. Using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to find connected components.
2. For each component, count the number of vertices and edges.
3. A component is **complete** if it has exactly `k * (k - 1) / 2` edges where `k` is the number of vertices (as every pair must be connected).

## Python Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def countCompleteComponents(self, n: int, edges: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(vertex: int) -> (int, int):
            visited[vertex] = True
            vertex_count, edge_count = 1, len(graph[vertex])
            for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    additional_vertices, additional_edges = dfs(neighbor)
                    vertex_count += additional_vertices
                    edge_count += additional_edges
            return vertex_count, edge_count

        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in edges:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
        
        visited = [False] * n
        complete_components_count = 0

        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                vertex_count, edge_count = dfs(i)
                if vertex_count * (vertex_count - 1) == edge_count:
                    complete_components_count += 1
        
        return complete_components_count
```
