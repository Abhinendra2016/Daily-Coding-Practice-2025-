# 2145. Count the Hidden Sequences

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers `differences` of size `n`, which represents the **differences between each pair of consecutive elements** in a hidden sequence of length `n + 1`.

You're also given two integers `lower` and `upper` that define the **inclusive range** `[lower, upper]` that each element of the hidden sequence must fall within.

### Objective:

Return the **number of possible hidden sequences** such that:
- The sequence starts at some integer `x`, and
- All values in the sequence stay within the range `[lower, upper]`.

If there are no such sequences, return `0`.

## ðŸ“˜ Example 1
Input: differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6  
Output: 2

## Explanation:
Two valid sequences are:

[3, 4, 1, 5]
[4, 5, 2, 6]


## Example 2


Input: differences = [3, -4, 5, 1, -2], lower = -4, upper = 5  
Output: 4


## Example 3

Input: differences = [4, -7, 2], lower = 3, upper = 6  
Output: 0

## Explanation:
No valid sequence stays within the range [3, 6].

## Constraints

n == differences.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
-10^5 <= differences[i] <= 10^5
-10^5 <= lower <= upper <= 10^5

## Solution
```python
import itertools

class Solution:
  def numberOfArrays(
      self,
      differences: list[int],
      lower: int,
      upper: int,
  ) -> int:
    prefix = list(itertools.accumulate(differences, initial=0))
    return max(0, (upper - lower) - (max(prefix) - min(prefix)) + 1)
```

## Explanation

Use prefix sum to simulate possible values in the hidden sequence.<br>
The range of prefix sums indicates how far the values can move relative to the starting point.<br>
The sequence is valid only if the entire range fits within [lower, upper].<br>
