# Problem 1976: Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination

## Problem Statement

You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with bi-directional roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a road between intersections `ui` and `vi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. 

You want to know **in how many ways** you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` **in the shortest amount of time**.

Return the number of ways you can arrive at your destination in the shortest amount of time. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo 10⁹ + 7**.

## Example 1:
Input: n = 7 roads = [[0,6,7],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[6,3,3],[3,5,1],[6,5,1],[2,5,1],[0,4,5],[4,6,2]]

Output: 4

Explanation: The shortest time from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes. There are 4 different ways to reach the destination in 7 minutes.


## Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n - 1 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `roads[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `1 <= timei <= 10⁹`
- There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.
- You can reach any intersection from any other intersection.

## Solution

We use **Dijkstra's Algorithm** with an additional `ways` array to count the number of ways to reach each node with the minimum distance.

```python
import heapq
import math

class Solution:
    def countPaths(self, n: int, roads: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v, w in roads:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
            graph[v].append((u, w))
        return self._dijkstra(graph, 0, n - 1)

    def _dijkstra(self, graph: list[list[tuple[int, int]]], src: int, dst: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        ways = [0] * len(graph)
        dist = [math.inf] * len(graph)

        ways[src] = 1
        dist[src] = 0
        minHeap = [(dist[src], src)]

        while minHeap:
            d, u = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            if d > dist[u]:
                continue
            for v, w in graph[u]:
                if d + w < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = d + w
                    ways[v] = ways[u]
                    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (dist[v], v))
                elif d + w == dist[v]:
                    ways[v] += ways[u]
                    ways[v] %= MOD

        return ways[dst]
```

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

O((E + V) * log V), where:
E is the number of edges.
V is the number of vertices.
Dijkstra's with a min-heap gives us log-factor for each node update.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

O(V + E) for storing the graph, distance array, and ways array.
