#  1399. Count Largest Group
You are given an integer `n`.

Each number from `1` to `n` is grouped according to the **sum of its digits**.

Return the **number of groups that have the largest size**.

##  Example 1


Input: n = 13
Output: 4

Explanation: Numbers from 1 to 13 are grouped by digit sum:

[1, 10] → sum = 1
[2, 11] → sum = 2
[3, 12] → sum = 3
[4, 13] → sum = 4
[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]
There are 4 groups of size 2: [1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13]

## Example 2
Input: n = 2
Output: 2

##  Explanation:

[1] → sum = 1
[2] → sum = 2
Each group has only 1 number. So, 2 groups of largest size.

```python
class Solution:
  def countLargestGroup(self, n: int) -> int:
    count = [0] * (9 * 4 + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
      count[self._getDigitSum(i)] += 1
    return count.count(max(count))

  def _getDigitSum(self, num: int) -> int:
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
```


## Explanation

We use a fixed-size list count to keep track of how many numbers belong to each digit sum.
Maximum digit sum possible for numbers ≤ 10⁴ is 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36.
After building the count array, we return the number of times the maximum group size occurs.
 
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

O(n × d), where d is the number of digits in n.
<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

O(1) since we only use a constant-sized array for digit sums.
