# Problem 1422: Maximum Score After Splitting a String

Given a string `s` of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (i.e., left substring and right substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

## Example 1
**Input:** 
s = "011101"
**Output:** 
5
**Explanation:**  
All possible ways of splitting `s` into two non-empty substrings are:
- left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5  
- left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4  
- left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3  
- left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2  
- left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3

## Example 2
**Input:** 
s = "00111"
**Output:** 
5
**Explanation:**  
When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5.

## Example 3
**Input:** 
s = "1111"
**Output:** 
3
## Constraints

- 2 <= `s.length` <= 500  
- The string `s` consists of characters `'0'` and `'1'` only.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def maxScore(self, s: str) -> int:
    ans = 0
    zeros = 0
    ones = s.count('1')
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
      if s[i] == '0':
        zeros += 1
      else:
        ones -= 1
      ans = max(ans, zeros + ones)
    return ans
```

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string once and also count the number of ones initially.

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using only a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the size of the input.

<h2>Explanation</h2>
1. Count the total number of ones in the string.
2. Traverse the string, keeping track of the number of zeros in the left substring and decrementing the count of ones for the right substring.
3. At each split point, calculate the score as the sum of zeros in the left substring and ones in the right substring.
4. Update the maximum score encountered.
5. Return the maximum score after considering all possible splits.
