# 2537. Count the Number of Good Subarrays

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of **good subarrays** of `nums`.

A **subarray** is considered **good** if it contains at least `k` **pairs of indices** `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## ðŸ“˜ Examples

### Example 1
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 10
Output: 1



### Example 2

Input: nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4], k = 2
Output: 4



## ðŸ“¥ Input

- `nums`: List of integers.
- `k`: An integer threshold for the minimum number of equal pairs.

---


## âœ… Output

- The total number of **good subarrays** in the array.





# Explanation:
# The good subarrays are:
# - [3,1,4,3,2,2] â†’ 2 pairs
# - [3,1,4,3,2,2,4] â†’ 3 pairs
# - [1,4,3,2,2,4] â†’ 2 pairs
# - [4,3,2,2,4] â†’ 2 pairs



```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countGood(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        cnt = Counter()
        ans = cur = 0
        i = 0
        for x in nums:
            cur += cnt[x]
            cnt[x] += 1
            while cur - cnt[nums[i]] + 1 >= k:
                cnt[nums[i]] -= 1
                cur -= cnt[nums[i]]
                i += 1
            if cur >= k:
                ans += i + 1
        return ans
```

# Explanation:
# Only one subarray exists with 10 pairs: the entire array itself.
Approach

This solution uses a sliding window and a counter to keep track of frequency of elements and their contribution to forming pairs.

For each right-bound of the window, update the current number of valid pairs.
Shrink the window from the left as long as we have more pairs than needed.
If current pairs â‰¥ k, then all subarrays ending at the current position and starting before or at the left-bound are good.
