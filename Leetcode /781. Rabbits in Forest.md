# 781. Rabbits in Forest
There is a forest with an **unknown number of rabbits**.  
Each rabbit was asked:  
> “How many rabbits have the same color as you?”

We collect all answers in an array `answers` where `answers[i]` is the response from the `i-th` rabbit.

Return the **minimum number of rabbits** that could be in the forest.

---

## 📘 Example 1

Input: answers = [1,1,2]
Output: 5


**Explanation**:  
- Two rabbits said “1” → They can belong to the same color group (say red).  
- One rabbit said “2” → This means there must be **3 rabbits** of that color, including this one.  
- But only one answered — the other two must be unaccounted for in `answers`.

**Total**: 2 (red group) + 3 (blue group) = **5 rabbits**

---

## 📘 Example 2



Input: answers = [10,10,10]
Output: 11


**Explanation**:  
- Each rabbit says “10” → meaning there are 11 rabbits of that color.
- But we only have 3 such responses, so they can't all be in the same group.
- Minimum groups needed = 1 group of 11 rabbits = **11 total rabbits**

---

## 📌 Constraints

- `1 <= answers.length <= 1000`  
- `0 <= answers[i] < 1000`

---

## ✅ Solution

```python
import collections

class Solution:
  def numRabbits(self, answers: list[int]) -> int:
    ans = 0
    count = collections.Counter()
    for answer in answers:
      if count[answer] % (answer + 1) == 0:
        ans += answer + 1
      count[answer] += 1
    return ans
```


<h2>Explanation</h2>

If a rabbit says “x”, there are at most x + 1 rabbits of its color.<br>
Group responses into clusters of size x + 1.<br>
Every time the count hits a multiple of x + 1, we start a new group and add that group size to the result.<br>

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

O(n) where n is the number of rabbits in the answers array.<br>

<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

O(n) to store counts in the Counter.<br>
