# Problem 2780: Minimum Index of a Valid Split

# Problem Statement

An element x of an integer array arr of length m is dominant if more than half the elements of arr have a value of x.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n with one dominant element.

You can split nums at an index i into two arrays nums[0, ..., i] and nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1], but the split is only valid if:

0 <= i < n - 1

Both nums[0, ..., i] and nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] have the same dominant element.

Return the minimum index of a valid split. If no valid split exists, return -1.

Examples

##  Example 1

Input: nums = [1,2,2,2]
Output: 2

##  Explanation:

We can split the array at index 2:

Left subarray: [1,2,2], dominant element is 2 (2 occurrences, 2 * 2 > 3).

Right subarray: [2], dominant element is 2 (1 occurrence, 1 * 2 > 1).

Both subarrays have the same dominant element.

The minimum valid split index is 2.

##  Example 2

Input: nums = [2,1,3,1,1,1,7,1,2,1]
Output: 4

##  Explanation:

We can split at index 4:

Left subarray: [2,1,3,1,1], dominant element is 1 (3 occurrences, 3 * 2 > 5).

Right subarray: [1,7,1,2,1], dominant element is 1 (3 occurrences, 3 * 2 > 5).

Both subarrays have the same dominant element.

The minimum valid split index is 4.

##  Example 3

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,7,2,2]
Output: -1

## Explanation:

No valid split exists where both subarrays have the same dominant element.

## Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
nums has exactly one dominant element.
## Solution Approach


Key Idea

Use two frequency counters:

count1: Tracks occurrences of numbers in the left subarray.<br>
count2: Tracks occurrences of numbers in the right subarray.<br>
Iterate through nums and update count1 and count2 dynamically.<br>
At each split point i, check if the dominant element remains dominant in both subarrays.<br>
Return the minimum index where this condition is met.<br>
Steps
Compute the frequency of all elements (count2 for the entire array).
Iterate through nums, updating count1 and decreasing from count2.
Check if the same dominant element is valid for both subarrays.
Return the first valid index found.


import collections
```python
class Solution:
  def minimumIndex(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
    count1 = collections.Counter()
    count2 = collections.Counter(nums)
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
      count1[num] += 1
      count2[num] -= 1
      
      if count1[num] * 2 > i + 1 and count2[num] * 2 > len(nums) - i - 1:
        return i
    
    return -1
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

O(n) → Iterating through the array once.

Overall Complexity: O(n)

S<h2>Tpace Complexity</h2>

O(n) → Using two hash maps (count1 and count2).

Explanation with Example:

Example Input

nums = [1,2,2,2]

Step-by-Step Execution

Initial count2: {1: 1, 2: 3}

Iterate through nums:

i = 0: count1 = {1: 1}, count2 = {1: 0, 2: 3} → Not valid.

i = 1: count1 = {1: 1, 2: 1}, count2 = {1: 0, 2: 2} → Not valid.

i = 2: count1 = {1: 1, 2: 2}, count2 = {1: 0, 2: 1} → Valid split at index 2.
