# Problem 3169: Count Days Without Meetings

You are given a positive integer `days` representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array `meetings` of size `n` where `meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the starting and ending days of meeting `i` (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but **no meetings are scheduled**.

## Example 1:
Input: days = 10 meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]

Output: 2

Explanation: There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.


## Example 2:


Input: days = 6 meetings = [[1,6]]

Output: 0

Explanation: Meetings are scheduled for all working days.


---

## Constraints:
- `1 <= days <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= meetings.length <= 10⁵`
- `meetings[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days`

---

## Solution Approach

Since the value of `days` can be very large (up to `10⁹`), we cannot create a direct array of size `days`. Instead, we sort the meeting intervals and merge them as we go, counting the gaps (free days) between merged intervals.

---

## Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def countDays(self, days: int, meetings: list[list[int]]) -> int:
        freeDays = 0
        prevEnd = 0

        for start, end in sorted(meetings):
            if start > prevEnd:
                freeDays += start - prevEnd - 1
            prevEnd = max(prevEnd, end)

        return freeDays + max(0, days - prevEnd)
```
<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

O(n log n) due to sorting the meetings.
O(n) for traversing the sorted meetings.
<h2>Space Complexity</h2>

O(1) additional space (excluding input storage).
